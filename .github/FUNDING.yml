# Funding FLARE  
## Support the development of relationally safe AI infrastructure

FLARE is an open-source, safety-first boundary engine designed to protect users from:

- synthetic intimacy  
- identity fusion  
- temporal-binding  
- dependency-inducing reassurance loops  

It sits between applications and LLMs, providing a minimal, auditable layer of relational safety.

If you believe this work is important — especially for young people, vulnerable users, and anyone interacting with AI systems daily — you can support its ongoing development.

## 💡 What Your Support Enables

Funding helps us:

- expand the core rule engine  
- improve detection patterns for identity fusion & synthetic intimacy  
- build additional adapters for more LLM providers  
- maintain a comprehensive test suite  
- draft relational safety specifications and documentation  
- engage with educators, researchers, and regulators  
- keep FLARE fully open-source and freely available  

The project is intentionally free of commercial dark-pattern incentives.  
Your support makes that sustainable.

## 🛠 Near-Term Goals (Where Sponsor Funding Goes)

- **v0.2**  
  - Streaming support  
  - More robust loop detection heuristics  
  - Initial logging hooks for research  
  - Bedrock / Gemini adapters  

- **v0.3**  
  - Optional audit log for boundary violations  
  - More granular rule configuration  
  - Developer tools for testing relational safety  

- **v1.0**  
  - Stable API  
  - Full provider coverage  
  - Policy-ready documentation for educational & clinical contexts  
  - Deployment recommendations for safeguarding environments  

Your sponsorship accelerates all of this.

## 🧠 Why Funding Matters

FLARE addresses a safety gap not covered by:

- content filters,  
- jailbreak defenders,  
- or traditional alignment work.

The harms it mitigates — relational overreach, blurred identity boundaries, dependency architecture — are increasing rapidly across consumer AI.

Keeping this work open, independent, and ethically uncompromised requires resources and committed support.
